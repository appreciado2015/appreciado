From building appliances in an ortho lab to treatment coordination, scheduling, practice management, marketing and patient communication services. After that long I think I've seen it all and am convinced that dentistry is a wonderfully unique business. It melds progressive dental and orthodontic technology, the art of the practitioner and the science of sociology. And when all three converge patients achieve a beautiful healthy smile and an exceptional level of service.</p>

He architected the back end for the AboveBorder mobile app, which automatically logs and analyzes daily location information for tax compliance for international travelers. It had dual personalities in that it could operate standalone or tie into existing SAP deployments.
